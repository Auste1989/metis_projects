ENTAILMENT_GRAPH_RTE_FORMAT dataset

*** Please read the "data_documentation" file before going on with the following description ***

Given a set of textual fragments (graph nodes), the task of constructing a Textual Entailment Graph (TEG) is to recognize all the entailments among the fragments, i.e. deciding which pairs of nodes are connected by directional edges. 
In our approach, the TEG is created through a pipeline of two separate sub-tasks: 
(1) further decomposing each input fragment and constructing its individual textual entailment graph, which we term fragment graph; 
(2) merging the fragment graphs into a single integrated TEG.

The "ENTAILMENT_GRAPH_RTE_FORMAT" dataset contains all the comparisons of nodes belonging to different fragment graphs, which are  needed to generate the final merged TEG (sub-task 2), along with their gold entailment labels. 

The dataset has the following (standard RTE) structure, composed of t(ext) and h(ypothesis) pairs, where the entailment attribute value is "ENTAILMENT" if t entails h. Each pairwise comparison of textual fragments (nodes) is presented in both directions.


 <pair id="237090.txt_2_0-522350.txt_3_0" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="usecase1">
    <t>More choice of drink</t>
    <h>better drinks selection</h>
  </pair>

<pair id="522350.txt_3_0-237090.txt_2_0" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="usecase1">
    <t>better drinks selection</t>
    <h>More choice of drink</h>
  </pair>
  
  <pair id="237090.txt_2_0-38058.txt_14_0" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="usecase1">
    <t>More choice of drink</t>
    <h>have bigger mugs for coffee</h>
  </pair>

Note that in the corresponding final TEGs (ENTAILMENT_GRAPH_DATASET_ENG_V2.0/FinalMergedGraph), nodes belonging to different fragment graphs in the TEG correspond to <t> and <h> elements, and edges correspond to "ENTAILMENT" pairs in this dataset.

This dataset is released under different configurations.

- rteFormatData: maintains the original structure of the dataset (subdivision into clusters).

Furthermore, following the evaluation methodology used in the Excitement project to evaluate the textual entailment open platform (EOP), we also release 4 different training/test splits of the dataset:

- balanced_pure_split  
- imbalanced_pure_split
- balanced_mix_split 
- imbalanced_mix_split

These training/test splits are structured along two orthogonal dimensions:

- balanced vs. imbalanced: in the "imbalanced" setting, all the original (positive and negative) pairs are kept in the training and test sets; in the "balanced" setting, some negative examples are removed to obtain a comparable number of positive and negative examples in each of the two sets;

- pure vs. mix: in the "pure" setting, pairs from the same cluster are all in the same set (training or test); in the "mix" setting, pairs from the same cluster are equally distributed between training and test set. 
In the "pure" setting, the following clusters are part of the test set: EMAIL0001, EMAIL0020.2, EMAIL0030, EMAIL0050, EMAIL0140, EMAIL0210, EMAIL0220, EMAIL0240, EMAIL0320, EMAIL0370, EMAIL0380, EMAIL0390. All the other clusters are part of the training set.
