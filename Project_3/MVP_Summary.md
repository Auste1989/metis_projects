## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Summary

### Topic:
School student's math grade (Pass / Fail)

#### Description:
Predicting student's mathematics grade based on sex, age, relationship status and weekly alcohol consumption.

### Why?
In my opinion drinking alcohol has a negative impact on learning. It would be interesting to see if that is indeed the case in a more scientific way rather than just from personal experience.
*In terms of domain knowledge, I don't have any specific knowledge other than my and my family and friends' experience*

### Plan of Action:

1. Clearly define the question
2. Get a good quality dataset (ideally multiple)
3. Select the features
4. Explore and Analyse the dataset(s)
5. Clean missing values, outliers (if any) and obvious mistakes
6. Transform the variables (dummify, etc.)
7. Store the data in an SQL database
8. Model using different models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
9. Verify which model performs the best and finalize it
10. Create online interface using Flask
11. Visualize the results
12. Create the presentation
13. This time actually practice presenting

### Dataset

| Sex | Age | Relationship Status | Alcohol Consumption / Week | Final Grade |   
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   
| 1 | 14 | 1 | 2 | Pass |   
| 0 | 17 | 1 | 0 | Fail |
