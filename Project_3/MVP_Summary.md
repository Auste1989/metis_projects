## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Summary

## Topic: School student's math grade (or Pass / Fail)
### Description:
Predicting student's mathematics class grade based on gender, age, relationship status and weekly alcohol consumption.

### Why? *My domain knowledge*
From personal experience, I think that drinking alcohol has a negative impact on grades, especially at school-age. It would be interesting to see if that is indeed the case.

### Plan of Action:

1. Clearly define the question
2. Get a good quality dataset (ideally multiple)
3. Select the features
4. Explore and Analyse the dataset(s)
5. Clean missing values, outliers (if any) and obvious mistakes
6. Transform the variables (dummify, etc.)
7. Store the data in an SQL database
8. Model using different models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
9. Verify which model performs the best and finalize it
10. Create online interface using Flask
11. Visualize the results
12. Create the presentation
13. This time actually practice presenting

### Dataset

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sex | Age | Relationship Status | Alcohol Consumption / Week | Final Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 14 | 1 | 2 | Pass |
| 0 | 17 | 1 | 0 | Fail |
