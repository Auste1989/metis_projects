## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Summary

### Problem:
Classifying students' grades into Pass / Fail

#### Description:
Predicting student's mathematics and Portuguese language grade based on various features, such as:
sex, age, relationship status, alcohol consumption, etc. In total 30 different features are available, appropriate ones will be selected using data analysis.

### Why?
Understanding how different characteristics, family situations and choices in life affect ones learning (through grades) can be very powerful. Especially when talking about youth education. If more schools did such data collection and analysis, we would probably have a much better education programs catered to different groups of students.
Moreover, actual science based information could be passed on to the parents who could, in turn, make smarter decisions for their children / teenagers.
As a side note, I have a *(strong)* opinion that drinking alcohol has a negative impact on learning. It would be interesting to see if that is, indeed, the case in a more scientific way rather than just from personal experience.

Overall, This is not so much of a business problem, but rather a social responsibility question.  
*In terms of domain knowledge, I don't have any specific knowledge other than my, my family's and friends' experience*

### Known Unknowns

* What relationship does alcohol consumption have on student's grades?
* What impact does being in a relationship have on student's grades?
* Is there a difference between the impact features have on math grades versus those of language skills (Portuguese)?
* How features like alcohol consumption correlate with age or relationship status?
* How does the family size or parent cohabitation impact student's grades?
* What relationship do extra-curricular activities have with alcohol consumption?
* Many more...
